Platform : android
Phase    : P0 — Scaffold + run
Commit   : 7218013   Branch: master
Spec refs: BUILD.md P0, DESIGN.md §token-set (color/type/radius), docs/06 §B1/§B6, docs/07 P0

Built (what a reviewer can verify):
- Gradle project with Compose Material 3, Hilt DI, version catalog (AGP 8.2.2, Kotlin 1.9.22,
  Compose BOM 2024.02.00)
- Material 3 light + dark color schemes from DESIGN.md tokens (warm-grey #F4F2ED bg, ink #1A1814,
  ember accent #D9542B, typography: Bricolage Grotesque display, Hanken Grotesk ui)
- Single-activity (@AndroidEntryPoint), Compose Navigation, Hilt DI
- Bottom NavBar (Home·Habits·Stats·Profile) + FAB per DESIGN-SYSTEM.md §4.4
- Placeholder Home, Habits, Stats, Profile screens
- SUPABASE_URL + SUPABASE_ANON_KEY via local.properties → BuildConfig (gitignored)
- .env.example with only the two keys per docs/08 §S1
- TASKS.md with "State of the world" block + run command

Self-check — fresh command output (Iron Law §B6):
- $ ./gradlew clean assembleDebug  →  BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 13s (40 actions: 13 executed, 27 from cache)
- $ ./gradlew lintDebug            →  BUILD SUCCESSFUL, 0 violations (report at lint-results-debug.html)
- APK produced at app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk

Deviations from spec (with reason):
- None.

Decisions needing the Lead (I did NOT guess):
- None.

How to verify quickly:
- run: ./gradlew clean assembleDebug && ./gradlew lintDebug
- open: APK on emulator → warm-grey placeholder Home with "Nothing live yet" empty state
- try: tap bottom nav tabs (Home, Habits, Stats, Profile)
```

➡️  PASTE TO LEAD: "Validate Questline android P0 against the spec. Reply PASS or a numbered fix list."
